This repo has things I work on in my free time to improve my JavaScripting and to play around with libraries outside of work. 

I have uploaded the js files so they can be browsed, but you need to open the zip to see them in action.

The important thing to note here is that I love learning new things and trying them out on my own time, as I'm sure you can tell by the variety of code samples.
