This repo has things I work on in my free time to improve my JavaScripting and to play around with libraries outside of work. 

I uploaded most of these without checking references since I was in a hurry. I figured taking a look at the JavaScript was more important than seeing CSS. If you notice some issues and want me to fix them, please let me know and I will update accordingly.

The important thing to note here is that I love learning new things and trying them out on my own time, as I'm sure you can tell by the variety of code samples.
